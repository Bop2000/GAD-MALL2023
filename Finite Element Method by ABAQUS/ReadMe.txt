1. Use HyperMesh to do the meshing work, the code is in the folder 'hypermesh_for_meshing'. Use the Gyroid STL file generated by MATLAB as the input, and HyperMesh will output a mesh file as the inout of ABAQUS.
2. Use ABAQUS to do the compression simulation, the code is in the folder 'abaqus_code'. The .rpt file generated by ABAQUS is the source file to calculate the Elastic modulus and Yield strength of the input Gyroid structure.
